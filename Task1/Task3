*/Task 3: Simple Interest Calculator  
Requirements 
● Create variables for: 
○ principal amount (number) 
○ rate of interest (number) 
○ time period (number) 
● Calculate simple interest using the formula: 
○ (principal * rate * time) / 100 
● Store the calculated interest in a variable. 
● Display the final result using console.log() in sentence format.*/


//Program

let principal = 10000;
let rate =5;
let time = 2;
let simpleInterest = (principal * rate * time)/100;
console.log(`The simple Interest  is: ${simpleInterest}`);



//Output
The simple Interest  is: 1000
